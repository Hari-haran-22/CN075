                - 1 tablespoon coriander powder<br>
                - 1/2 teaspoon garam masala powder<br>
                - 1/2 teaspoon black pepper powder<br>
                - 1 teaspoon fennel seeds (saunf)<br>
                - 1 sprig curry leaves<br>
                - Salt to taste<br>
                - 2 tablespoons coconut oil or any cooking oil<br>
                - Fresh coriander leaves for garnish<br>
                
                
                </p>
                <p class="title"><b>Instructions:</b></p>
                <p>
                    1. Marinate the beef pieces with ginger-garlic paste, turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, garam masala powder, black pepper powder, and salt. 
                    Mix well to coat the beef evenly with the marinade. Allow it to marinate for at least 30 minutes or longer for better flavor.<br>
                    <br>
                    2. Heat coconut oil or cooking oil in a pan or pressure cooker over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.<br>
                    <br>
                    3. Add the slit green chilies, curry leaves, and fennel seeds. Sauté for a minute until fragrant.<br>
                    <br>
                    4. Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they turn soft and mushy.<br>
                    <br>
                    5. Add the marinated beef to the pan and mix well with the onion-tomato mixture.<br>
                    <br>
                    6. If using a pressure cooker, add a little water (about 1/4 cup) to help cook the beef. Close the pressure cooker lid and cook for 
                    about 4-5 whistles or until the beef is tender. If using a regular pan, cover and cook on low heat until the beef is cooked through, stirring occasionally and adding water if needed.<br>
                    <br>
                    7. Once the beef is cooked, remove the lid and increase the heat to medium-high. Stir-fry the beef until the moisture 
                    evaporates and the beef pieces turn golden brown and slightly crispy on the edges.<br>
                    <br>
                    8. Adjust seasoning if needed and garnish with fresh coriander leaves.<br>
                    <br>
                    9. Serve hot with rice, roti, or as a side dish with your favorite meal.<br>
                    <br>
                    Enjoy the delicious and aromatic Beef Fry! Adjust the spice levels according to your preference for a perfect balance of flavors.<br>
