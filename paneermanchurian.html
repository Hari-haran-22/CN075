            <p class="title"><b>Description:</b></p>
            <p>>Paneer Manchurian is a Indo-Chinese dish that features paneer (Indian cottage cheese) cubes coated in a tangy, spicy sauce. The paneer is typically 
                first coated with a batter made from flour and spices, then deep-fried until crispy. It's then tossed in a flavorful sauce made with garlic, ginger,
                 onions, bell peppers, soy sauce, and chili sauce. The dish is garnished with spring onions and sometimes sesame seeds for added flavor and texture. 
                 Paneer Manchurian is loved for its fusion of Indian and Chinese flavors, making it a popular vegetarian option in many restaurants and homes.</p>

                <p>
                    1. In a bowl, combine grated paneer, all-purpose flour, cornflour, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, and salt. 
                    Mix well to form a dough-like mixture.<br>
                    <br>
                    2. Divide the mixture into small portions and shape them into small balls.<br>
                    <br>
                    3. Heat oil in a deep frying pan or wok over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, fry the paneer balls in batches until they are golden brown and crispy. 
                    Remove them from the oil and drain excess oil on paper towels. Set aside.<br>
                    <br>
                    4. In the same pan, remove excess oil, leaving about 1 tablespoon.<br>
                    <br>
                    5. Add chopped onions, capsicum, and green chilies. Stir-fry on high heat for 2-3 minutes until they are slightly tender.<br>
                    <br>
                    6. Add soy sauce, tomato ketchup, chili sauce, vinegar, sugar, ginger-garlic paste, and salt. Mix well.<br>
                    <br>
                    7. Pour in water and bring the mixture to a boil.<br>
                    <br>
                    8. Once boiling, add the cornflour slurry while continuously stirring to avoid lumps. Cook until the sauce thickens to your desired consistency.<br>
                    <br>
                    9. Add the fried paneer balls to the sauce and gently toss them until they are well coated with the sauce.<br>
                    <br>
                    10. Garnish with chopped spring onions, if desired.<br>
                    <br>
                    11. Serve Paneer Manchurian hot with steamed rice or noodles.<br>
                    <br>
                    Enjoy your flavorful Paneer Manchurian!<br>
