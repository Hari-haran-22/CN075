            <p class="title"><b>Description:</b></p>
            <p>Butter Chicken is a popular North Indian dish characterized by tender pieces of chicken cooked in a creamy tomato-based sauce. 
                It's known for its rich and velvety texture, mildly spiced flavors, and vibrant orange-red color. The chicken is typically marinated 
                in yogurt and spices before being cooked in a sauce made from butter, tomatoes, cream, and various spices such as garam masala, cumin, and fenugreek.</p>

                <p class="title"><b>Instructions:</b></p>
                <p>
                    1. In a bowl, combine yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala powder, and salt.<br> 
                    Add the chicken pieces and coat them well with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 4 hours.
                    <br>
                    2. Heat 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 tablespoon of oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the marinated chicken pieces and 
                    cook until they are browned on all sides and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.<br>
                    <br>
                    3. In the same pan, add the remaining butter and oil. Add the chopped onion and sauté until they turn soft and translucent.<br>
                    <br>
                    4. Add ginger-garlic paste and sauté for another couple of minutes until the raw smell disappears.<br>
                    <br>
                    5. Add the tomato puree and cook until the oil starts to separate from the mixture and it thickens.<br>
                    <br>
                    6. Add red chili powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, and garam masala powder. Mix well and cook for 
                    a few minutes until the spices are well incorporated into the sauce.<br>
                    <br>
                    7. Lower the heat and stir in the heavy cream. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, stirring continuously, 
                    until the sauce is creamy and smooth.<br>
                    <br>
                    8. Add honey or sugar if desired to balance the acidity of the tomatoes. Adjust salt to taste.<br>
                    <br>
                    9. Add the cooked chicken pieces to the sauce and mix until they are evenly coated. Simmer for 5-7 minutes to 
                    allow the flavors to meld together.<br>
                    <br>
                    10. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and kasuri methi (if using).<br>
                    <br>
                    11. Serve hot with naan, rice, or roti.<br>
                    <br>
                    Enjoy your homemade Butter Chicken, a perfect blend of creamy and spicy flavors!<br>
