                For Spice Bag (Potli):<br>
                - 1 cinnamon stick<br>
                - 4 green cardamom pods<br>
                - 4 cloves<br>

                - 1 bay leaf<br>
                </p>
                <p class="title"><b>Instructions:</b></p>
                <p>1. Wash and soak broken wheat, whole wheat grains, and barley together in water for at least 2 hours. Wash and 
                    soak all the lentils together in water for at least 1 hour.<br>
                    <br>
                    2. Tie the spice bag ingredients in a piece of muslin cloth to make a potli.<br>
                    <br>
                    3. In a large pot or pressure cooker, heat some ghee or oil over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and 
                    sauté until golden brown.<br>
                    <br>
                    4. Add the ginger-garlic paste and slit green chilies. Sauté for a couple of minutes until the raw smell 
                    disappears.<br>
                    <br>
                    5. Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they turn soft and mushy.<br>
                    <br>
                    6. Add the mutton or chicken pieces to the pot and cook until they are browned on all sides.<br>
                    <br>
                    7. Drain the soaked wheat, barley, and lentils. Add them to the pot along with the spice bag (potli), 
                    turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala powder, and salt. Mix well to combine.<br>
                    <br>
                    8. Add enough water to cover all the ingredients in the pot. If using a pressure cooker, cover and 
                    cook for about 4-5 whistles until the meat and grains are tender. If using a regular pot, cover and 
                    cook on low heat for about 2-3 hours until everything is cooked and the mixture becomes thick and creamy. 
                    Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.<br>
                    <br>
                    9. Once the haleem is cooked, remove the spice bag (potli) from the pot and discard.<br>
                    
                    10. Using a hand blender or a potato masher, blend the cooked mixture until you achieve a smooth and creamy 
                    consistency. Add more water if needed to reach your desired thickness.<br>
                    <br>
                    11. Adjust seasoning if needed and stir in the chopped coriander and mint leaves.<br>
                    <br>
                    12. Serve hot garnished with fried onions and a drizzle of lemon juice.<br>
                    <br>
                    Enjoy your delicious Hyderabadi Haleem with naan, roti, or rice! It's a perfect dish for special occasions 
                    or as a comforting meal during Ramadan.<br>
