            <p class="title"><b>Description:</b></p>
            <p>Venn Pongal is a traditional South Indian dish made from rice and lentils, typically enjoyed for breakfast or as a comfort food. It's cooked together
                with cumin seeds, black pepper, ginger, and curry leaves, giving it a flavorful and aromatic taste. Once cooked to a creamy consistency, it's often
                 garnished with cashews, peanuts, and ghee (clarified butter). Venn Pongal is served hot and pairs well with coconut chutney and sambar, making it a 
                 beloved dish in South Indian cuisine.</p>

               - 2-3 green chilies, finely chopped (adjust to taste)<br>
               - 1/4 cup cashew nuts (optional)<br>
               - A pinch of asafoetida (hing)<br>
               - Salt to taste<br>

                </p>
                <p class="title"><b>Instructions:</b></p>
                <p>
                    1. Rinse the rice and moong dal separately under running water until the water runs clear. Drain and set aside.<br>
                    <br>
                    2. In a pressure cooker or a heavy-bottomed pot, add the rice and moong dal along with 4 cups of water. Pressure cook for about 3-4 
                    whistles or cook in a pot until the rice and dal are soft and mushy. Set aside.<br>
                    <br>
                    3. Heat ghee and oil together in a pan over medium heat.<br>
                    <br>
                    4. Add cumin seeds and black peppercorns. Let them splutter.<br>
                    <br>
                    5. Add chopped ginger, green chilies, and cashew nuts (if using). Saut√© until the cashews turn golden brown.<br>
                    <br>
                    6. Add a pinch of asafoetida (hing) and mix well.<br>
                    <br>
                    7. Transfer the cooked rice and dal mixture into the pan with the tempering. Mix well to combine.<br>
                    <br>
                    8. Add salt to taste and mix thoroughly.<br>
                    <br>
                    9. If the pongal appears too thick, you can adjust the consistency by adding a little hot water.<br>
                    <br>
                    10. Allow the pongal to simmer for a few minutes, stirring occasionally, until it reaches your desired consistency.<br>
                    <br>
                    11. Garnish with freshly chopped coriander leaves, if desired.<br>
                    <br>
                    12. Serve Venn Pongal hot with coconut chutney, sambar, or gotsu (a South Indian curry made with vegetables).<br>
                    <br>
                    Enjoy your delicious and comforting Venn Pongal!<br>
