            <p class="title"><b>Description:</b></p>
            <p>Butter naan is a popular Indian bread made from refined flour dough. It's typically leavened with yeast or baking powder, rolled into 
                flattened shapes, and cooked in a tandoor or oven. The naan is brushed with butter, giving it a soft texture and a rich, buttery flavor.
                 It's enjoyed as a staple accompaniment to various Indian dishes, such as curries and kebabs, and is appreciated for its light and fluffy 
                texture.</p>
            <p class="title"><b>Ingredients:</b></p>
            <p>- 2 cups all-purpose flour (maida)<br>
                - 1/2 teaspoon baking powder<br>
                - 1/4 teaspoon baking soda<br>
                - 1/2 teaspoon salt<br>
                - 1 tablespoon sugar<br>
                - 1/4 cup plain yogurt<br>
                - 2 tablespoons oil or melted butter<br>
                - 1/2 cup lukewarm water (approximately)<br>
                - Melted butter for brushing (for serving)<br>
                </p>
                <p class="title"><b>Instructions:</b></p>
                <p>
                    1. In a large mixing bowl, sift together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar.<br>
                    <br>
                    2. Add the plain yogurt and oil (or melted butter) to the dry ingredients. Mix well until crumbly.<br>
                    <br>
                    3. Gradually add lukewarm water, little by little, and knead the dough until it comes together and is smooth and elastic. 
                    You may not need to use all of the water, so add it slowly.<br>
                    <br>
                    4. Once the dough is formed, cover it with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and let it rest for about 2 hours at room temperature. 
                    This allows the dough to ferment and develop flavor.<br>
                    <br>
                    5. After the resting period, divide the dough into small equal-sized balls.<br>
                    <br>
                    6. Preheat a cast-iron skillet or tawa over medium-high heat.<br>
                    <br>
                    7. Take one dough ball and roll it out into an oval or round shape using a rolling pin. The thickness should be around 1/4 inch.<br>
                    <br>
                    8. Lightly brush one side of the rolled-out dough with water.<br>
                    <br>
                    9. Place the wet side of the rolled-out dough onto the preheated skillet or tawa, with the wet side facing down. This helps the naan stick to the skillet.<br>
                    <br>
                    10. Cook the naan for about 1-2 minutes on one side until bubbles start to appear.<br>
                    <br>
                    11. Flip the naan using tongs and cook for another 1-2 minutes on the other side until it puffs up and gets brown spots.<br>
                    <br>
                    12. Remove the naan from the skillet and brush the top with melted butter.<br>
                    <br>
                    13. Repeat the process with the remaining dough balls.<br>
                    <br>
                    14. Serve the butter naan hot with your favorite curry or dip.<br>
                    <br>
                    Enjoy your homemade butter naan!<br>
