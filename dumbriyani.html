                <p>
                    1.Wash and soak the basmati rice in water for about 30 minutes. Drain and set aside.<br>
                    <br>
                    2. Marinate the chicken (or meat/vegetables) with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, half of the chopped 
                    coriander leaves, half of the chopped mint leaves, and salt. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes.<br>
                    <br>
                    3. Heat ghee in a large heavy-bottomed pot. Add the sliced onions and sauté until golden brown.<br>
                    <br>
                    4. Add the whole spices and green chilies. Sauté for a minute until fragrant.<br>
                    <br>
                    5. Add the marinated chicken (or meat/vegetables) along with chopped tomatoes. Cook until the chicken is partially cooked and tomatoes are soft.<br>
                    <br>
                    6. In a separate pot, bring water to a boil. Add salt and the soaked rice. Cook until the rice is 70-80% cooked. Drain and set aside.<br>
                    <br>
                    7. Layer the partially cooked rice over the chicken mixture in the pot. Sprinkle garam masala powder,
                    remaining chopped coriander leaves, and mint leaves over the rice.<br>
                    <br>
                    8. Drizzle saffron milk over the rice for a beautiful color and aroma. You can also add fried onions for additional 
                    flavor at this stage.<br>
                    <br>
                    9. Prepare the dough and use it to seal the edges of the pot.<br>
                    <br>
                    10. Mix milk, water, and kewra water (or rose water) and pour it gently over the rice.<br>
                    <br>
                    11. Cover the pot tightly with a lid and place it on a tawa (griddle) over low heat. Let it cook on dum (steam) for 
                    about 20-25 minutes until the rice and chicken are completely cooked and aromatic.<br>
                    <br>
                    12. Once done, remove the pot from heat and let it sit for another 5-10 minutes before opening the lid.<br>
                    <br>
                    13. Gently fluff the biryani with a fork and serve hot with raita (yogurt dip) or salad.<br>
                    <br>
