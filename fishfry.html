            <p>Fish fry is a delicious dish featuring fish fillets coated in a seasoned batter and shallow-fried until golden and crispy. It's a popular 
                dish in many cuisines around the world, with variations in spices and breading. The fish is typically marinated with spices like chili powder, 
                turmeric, and cumin before being dipped in a mixture of flour or breadcrumbs. It's then fried until crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. 
                Fish fry is often served as an appetizer or main course, accompanied by lemon wedges and tartar sauce or chutney for dipping.</p>
            <p class="title"><b>Ingredients:</b></p>
            <p>- 4 fish fillets (such as tilapia, cod, or catfish)<br>
                - 1 tablespoon lemon juice<br>
                - 1 teaspoon red chili powder<br>
                - 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder<br>
                - 1 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste<br>
                - Salt to taste<br>
                - 2 tablespoons rice flour or all-purpose flour<br>
                - 2 tablespoons cornmeal or breadcrumbs (optional, for added crunch)<br>
                - Oil for frying<br>
                </p>
                <p class="title"><b>Instructions:</b></p>
                <p>
                    1. Wash the fish fillets and pat them dry with paper towels.<br>
                    <br>
                    2. In a bowl, mix together lemon juice, red chili powder, turmeric powder, ginger-garlic paste, and salt to form a marinade.<br>
                    <br>
                    3. Rub the marinade evenly over the fish fillets, ensuring they are well coated. Let them marinate 
                    for at least 15-20 minutes in the refrigerator.<br>
                    <br>
                    4. In a shallow dish, mix together rice flour (or all-purpose flour) and cornmeal (or breadcrumbs), if using.<br>
                    <br>
                    5. Heat oil in a frying pan or skillet over medium-high heat.<br>
                    <br>
                    6. Dredge each marinated fish fillet in the flour mixture, shaking off any excess.<br>
                    <br>
                    7. Carefully place the coated fish fillets in the hot oil, making sure not to overcrowd the pan.<br>
                    <br>
                    8. Fry the fish fillets for about 3-4 minutes on each side or until they are golden brown and crispy.<br>
                    <br>
                    9. Once cooked, remove the fish fillets from the oil and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil.<br>
                    <br>
                    10. Serve the fish fry hot with lemon wedges and your favorite dipping sauce or alongside rice and vegetables.<br>
                    <br>
                    Enjoy your delicious homemade fish fry!<br>
